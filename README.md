# What is Presenceanator?

Presenceanator is a software designed to help making a custom Discord Rich Presence, easy and fast.

# How to use

Once you download the latest version, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application (The name of your application will be the name of the game Presenceanator says youre playing). Once you make your application, copy the application ID, and once you do that, open up Presenceanator and paste the application ID into the application ID text box. The rest should be pretty self explanatory.
